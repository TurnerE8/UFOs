# UFOs
## Purpose 
  The purpose of this module and overall challenge was to build a webpage for Dana that displays UFO sightings data. In the module, we made a table that could be filtered. In the challenge, we were asked to create multiple criteria from which the user could filter through the data. 
  
## Challenges/Results 
  Both edits made to the app.js file and the index.html were rather difficult. I had to refer to the module work and Stack Overflow, especially when it came to the final steps of looping through the filters object. For my index.html file, it does not seem to be entirely functional; however, I simply made removed the list element that had previously created the button and then placed four more list elements in its place.
